When users go to the Virtual Ear screen, they see a visual of an ear that represents a ear. This virtual ear reacts to the noise around them.

2.  Visualization of inner Parts of Ear to external Sounds:

The virtual ear shows how noise can harm the ear. Depending on how loud the noise is, the ear animation will display different levels of damage to the eardrum and inner parts. The louder the noise, the more severe the damage shown.

3. Real-Time Decibel Recording:

While the animation plays, the app records the surrounding noise levels (decibels) in real-time. This recording affects how the animation behaves:

Loud Noise: If the noise is loud, the animation speeds up, showing more rapid and serious damage to the ear.

Medium Noise: If the noise is at a moderate level, the animation proceeds at a normal pace, showing moderate damage to the ear.

Quiet Noise: If the noise level is low, the animation slows down, showing less damage.


4. Interactive Dialogue Box:

After the animation finishes, the user can press the "Next" button, which opens a dialogue box. This box provides important information:

Noise Description: It tells the user what the noise level around them was like (e.g. quiet, moderate, loud).

Eardrum Functionality: It explains how well the eardrum is working based on the recorded noise, and whether there are signs of damage.

Potential Problems: It warns the user about possible hearing issues that might occur due to the noise exposure, like hearing loss or ringing in the ears.

Uses :
1.The Virtual Ear Visualization helps users understand how noise affects their hearing. By seeing the inner vibrations of eatdrum visually, users can better grasp the immediate impact of their environment on their ears.

2.The feature raises awareness about the importance of taking care of oneâ€™s ears. It informs users about the risks of ignoring ear health, motivating them to seek quieter places or use ear protection when needed.

3.Interactive Experience:
The Virtual Ear Visualization is engaging and easy to use. The combination of real-time noise tracking, dynamic animation, and informative dialogue keeps users involved and informed about their hearing health.
