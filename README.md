When users go to the Virtual Ear screen, they see a visual of an ear that represents a ear. This virtual ear reacts to the noise around them.

The virtual ear shows how noise can harm the ear. Depending on how loud the noise is, the ear animation will display different levels of damage to the eardrum and inner parts. The louder the noise, the more severe the damage shown.

While the animation plays, the app records the surrounding noise levels (decibels) in real-time. This recording affects how the animation behaves:

Loud Noise: If the noise is loud, the animation speeds up, showing more rapid and serious damage to the ear.

Medium Noise: If the noise is at a moderate level, the animation proceeds at a normal pace, showing moderate damage to the ear.



Quiet Noise: If the noise level is low, the animation slows down, showing less damage.

Uses :
1.The Virtual Ear Visualization helps users understand how noise affects their hearing. By seeing the inner vibrations of eatdrum visually, users can better grasp the immediate impact of their environment on their ears.

2.The feature raises awareness about the importance of taking care of one’s ears. It informs users about the risks of ignoring ear health, motivating them to seek quieter places or use ear protection when needed.

3.Interactive Experience:
The Virtual Ear Visualization is engaging and easy to use. The combination of real-time noise tracking, dynamic animation, and informative dialogue keeps users involved and informed about their hearing health.

“This screen displays the current noise level in your surroundings, measured in decibels (dB). It provides real-time feedback on the intensity of sound in your environment . The display will update dynamically, allowing you to monitor changes in noise levels as they happen. When user taps profile icon, it navigates to profile dashboard. “

Uses:

“Monitoring the noise level in your surroundings can be crucial for protecting your hearing health. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels can lead to hearing damage or loss. By keeping track of the decibel level, you can make informed decisions, such as moving to a quieter area or using hearing protection when necessary. This feature helps you stay aware of potentially harmful noise environments, whether you're at work, home, or outdoors, contributing to long-term hearing safety and well-being.”

UI Changes:
“ When user taps Start button, the screen records audio in surrounding .While audio recording , according to decibel level , the circle fills proportionally to audio captured. As the app records the surrounding noise, you'll see a dynamic waveform moving across the screen.”
